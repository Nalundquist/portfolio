					<h3><span class="sparkle">VACATION</span></h3>
					<p>A website for a fictional travel company selling trips to the Cappadocia region of Turkey designed to familiarize myself with the usage of bootstrap functionalities.  Cappadocia is a very pretty place and I wouldn't mind getting a cave there someday.</p>

					<h3><span class="sparkle">ANIMAL SHELTER</span></h3>
					<p>A website co-created with Najma Abdi as an exercise in using cascading priority/specificity in stylesheets.  For a fictional animal shelter, lots of cute pics :).</p>

					<h3><span class="sparkle">CUPCAKE</span></h3>
					<p>A website co-created with Skylan Lew while honing skills with div/span parameters and tables.  Quite ugly, not unintentionally.</p>

				<div class="project">
					<h3><span class="sparkle">CENTERCAT</span></h3>
					<p>A website co-created with Skylan Lew that began as a test of centering box elements and quickly spiraled into an extended flexbox experiment/attempt to create a chaotic tumblr-like.</p>

					<h3><span class="sparkle">FAVORITE BAND</span></h3>
					<p>A website co-created with Skylan Lew for the vegetable-themed metal band Cruciferot, which is (again) fictional but the name is not taken, just saying.  Experimenting with box divs, floats, width parameters.</p>

					<h3><span class="sparkle">NOMI'S WORLD</span></h3>
					<p>Website for my old, well loved cat.  No pictures of her on it, unfortunately.  Very rudimentary, not pretty but has pictures of both Klaus Nomi and Nomi from the film Showgirls who are both idols of mine.</p>

					<h3><span class="sparkle">RESORT</span></h3>
					<p>Co-created with Tim Empey, a website for a shady cruise ship company.  Doesn't seem safe.  Mostly experimenting with our first stylesheets and branching git repos/commit paths.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="card-text">
						<p>I did <em>very</em> poorly in high school and did not fare much better in my primary forays into community college.  I am currently as of this writing (August of 2022) enrolled in the C#/React program online at Epicodus.  So far, so good.</p>

						<span class="sparkle">PREVIOUS EMPLOYMENT</span>
					</div>
					<div class="card-text">
						<p>I've tried my hand at a lot of things.  Most recently I spent four and a half years as both a direct service staff at a shelter for persons experiencing homelessness and a peer counselor/case worker for people either in the aforementioned group or folks transitioning into housing.  Before that I've worked in such diverse fields as construction, dishwashing, cooking, dishwashing, carnie, dishwashing, and dishwashing.</p>

						<span class="sparkle">WHY CODE?</span>
					</div>
					<div class="card-text">
						<p>I've been a low-mid level nerd since I was but a tot but all of my previous attempts at coding haven't really gone anywhere.  I recently decided to move from my previous field which I was very passionate about but included a lot of vicarious trauma for not-very-high wages to one where I could have some modicum of enthusiasm for the tasks I did to one where I enjoyed it but didn't have to break up fights on a regular basis (fingers crossed?).</p>

						<p>I'm quick with a joke, generally personable, and smart as a tack.  I have lived experience with a lot of different kinds of people and environments so can find commonality with a lot of folks.  I work <strong>really</strong> hard.</p>
