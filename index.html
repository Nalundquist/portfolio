					<p>A website for a fictional travel company selling trips to the Cappadocia region of Turkey designed to familiarize myself with the usage of bootstrap functionalities.  Cappadocia is a very pretty place and I wouldn't mind getting a cave there someday.</p>

					<div class="card-text">
						<p>I did <em>very</em> poorly in high school and did not fare much better in my primary forays into community college.  I am currently as of this writing (August of 2022) enrolled in the C#/React program online at Epicodus.  So far, so good.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="card-text">
						<p>I've tried my hand at a lot of things.  Most recently I spent four and a half years as both a direct service staff at a shelter for persons experiencing homelessness and a peer counselor/case worker for people either in the aforementioned group or folks transitioning into housing.  Before that I've worked in such diverse fields as construction, dishwashing, cooking, dishwashing, carnie, dishwashing, and dishwashing.</p>

						<span class="sparkle">WHY CODE?</span>
					</div>
					<div class="card-text">
						<p>I've been a low-mid level nerd since I was but a tot but all of my previous attempts at coding haven't really gone anywhere.  I recently decided to move from my previous field which I was very passionate about but included a lot of vicarious trauma for not-very-high wages to one where I could have some modicum of enthusiasm for the tasks I did to one where I enjoyed it but didn't have to break up fights on a regular basis (fingers crossed?).</p>
