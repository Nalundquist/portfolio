# PORTFOLIO

### Created by Noah Lundquist (August 2022)

## Description

A portfolio of my work up to this point.  Includes most of the projects I've worked on (omitted ones that were just me transcribing pre-written code for an assignment) as well as an about me sidebar with my picture and a relatively extensive "About me".  Uses both bootstrap and custom stylesheet.  Made two linked sites about bikes and harm reduction that can be considered as expansions of my "Hobbies/Interests" section.
