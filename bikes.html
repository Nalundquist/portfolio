					<p>The beautiful angel that took me through early-to-mid COVID.  Named after Shirley Bassey, singer of the Bond themes "Goldfinger" and "Diamonds are Forever".  Smooth as butter, prone to flat tires.  Once got one on a very ill-advised ride north on the shoulder of I-5, changing it was very unpleasant.  Single speed or fixed gear depending on the way the rear tire was attached (aka a flip-flop hub).  Was stolen out of my living room in May of 2022 and after a cursory search I decided she was in the wind.  I hope whoever has her today appreciates her.  </p>

					<h3><span class="sparkle">BUFFY</span></h3>
					<img src="img/bike2.png">
					<p>The inheritor of the flame.  Named after Buffy Sainte-Marie, singer of "Universal Soldier", "Cod'ine", and many other songs.  Not the vampire slayer, nothing personal.  I was initially non-plussed on this bike as I've been riding a single speed for roughly two years straight and changing gears was confusing to me.  She became the main bike after Shirley's disappearance and once I got used to her she has many advantages.  Hills that once were impossible are now doable and she can still bomb real dang fast if need be.  Significantly hardier, I have had all of one flat in our time together which is a blessing.  Bless you, Buffy.

						<span class="sparkle">WHY BIKES??</span>
					</div>
					<div class="card-text">
						<p>I came into my young adulthood around a lot of semi-macho bike punks and always thought biking was not an activity for me.  The vibe they gave off was inaccessible and clique-y (probably some amount of youthful insecurity on my part).  At the start of COVID I came into possession of a single-speed which I started using as my commuter to work since I was not fond of using the bus during a pandemic we didn't know the properties of and I didn't have a car or license.  Long story short, it was a miracle for my mental and physical health.  I can't claim it'll cure exactly what ails any particular person but being able to get up and go, see whatever urban or rural destinations you so please, and not pay for gas is pretty amazing.</p>
