						<p>I came into my young adulthood around a lot of semi-macho bike punks and always thought biking was not an activity for me.  The vibe they gave off was inaccessible and clique-y (probably some amount of youthful insecurity on my part).  At the start of COVID I came into possession of a single-speed which I started using as my commuter to work since I was not fond of using the bus during a pandemic we didn't know the properties of and I didn't have a car or license.  Long story short, it was a miracle for my mental and physical health.  I can't claim it'll cure exactly what ails any particular person but being able to get up and go, see whatever urban or rural destinations you so please, and not pay for gas is pretty amazing.</p>
